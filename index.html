Usually includes development of a user friendly interface to operate the program. Everything detail that makes the program operate correctly is developed through the process of software engineering </p>

  <h2>Post Chapter 1 reading </h2>
  <p> - put in extra effort to make your code worth it <br>
      - dont make excuses, find solutions <br>
      - decide the best way to present ideas and codes <br>
      - always be trying to learn more directly related and indirectly related <br>
      - dont let little problems build up <br>
      - be willing to initiate and respond to communication <br>

    <p> It seems that good programming technique is to avoid repetition as much as possible, even if it is inadvertant there appears to be no other way around it, it is usually better to not repeat knowledge. A good tip is to take the time now to prevent problems later. ORTHAGONAL - changing one method does not affect another.AKA ability to change interface without affecting the database. Using multiple languages on one project isnt bad and can make it easier in the long run. "tracer bullets" can help when you're dealing with a lot of unknowns or shooting in the dark. Prototypes are sometimes a better option than "tracer bullets". Estimating accurately is important for understanding when a project will be done and allows for realistic expectations.

      This chapter provides a lot of hints and tips for working on large scale projects and how to keep the code tighty and make it run smoothly for everyone involved on the project. It is a good guideline for such projects.
